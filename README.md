Step 1.  
 * Created a project environment in VS Code.
 * Installed Flask in the virtual environment using `python -m pip install flask`
 * Created a simple Flask app. 
 * See [Flask Tutorial in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask) for more details.

Step 2. 
* Used [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templating engine to pass variables defined in `app.py` to `index.html`. In the html file we write variables surrounded by double curly braces, such as `{{ variable_name }}`. Jinja also allows us to write code similar to Python syntax inside an html file.
* Updated webpage footer to display the current year.
